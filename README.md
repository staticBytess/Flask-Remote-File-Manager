# Flask Remote File Manager

A self-hosted, Flask-based web file manager designed for local network (LAN) file management and batch script execution. This tool allows you to manage server files and trigger custom scripts directly from a mobile or desktop browser without using SSH.

## Key Features
### **File & Folder Management**
* **CRUD Operations:** Create new directories, rename files on the fly, and delete unnecessary data directly through the browser.
* **Bulk Move:** Select multiple files and move them into a target directory in a single action,.
* **Smart Selection:** Efficiently handle large directories with "Select All," "Clear Selection," and a "View Selected" filter to verify your queue before processing.

### **Remote Script Execution**
* **Batch Processing:** Trigger custom Python or Bash scripts against selected files. Ideal for automation tasks like **transcoding**, **unzipping**, or **metadata tagging**.
* **Real-time Logging:** A dedicated log panel providing instant feedback on script output, process status, and system confirmations.

### **Optimized for Home Labs**
* **Mobile-First Design:** A responsive UI tailored for mobile browsers, making it easy to manage your server from a phone or tablet while away from your desk.
* **LAN-Centric:** Built for speed and simplicity within your local network, removing the friction of command-line operations for routine file tasks.
